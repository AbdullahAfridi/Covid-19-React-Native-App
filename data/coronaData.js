Ginger is a spiced root which works effectively in reducing symptoms of sore throat, while honey is a soothing anti-inflammatory agent which strengthen your immunity. This unique combination also acts as an expectorant and opens up your sinuses, getting rid of the mucus and washing down irritants which might be giving you an itchy and scratchy throat.  2. Have mulethi (liquorice root)Mulethi is a traditional Ayurvedic herb which is added in chai as well as consumed when you feel the onset of a viral infection settling in. It's also a good reliever for the itchiness caused by a sore throat. Mulethi has also been found to contain helpful anti-viral properties which target bad disease-spreading pathogens. It also produces healthy mucus, which softens the pain and roughness. The antioxidants in it take care of any free radicals which may harm your immunity.   3. Drink apple cider vinegar Apple cider vinegar (ACV) has alkaline properties which have anti-inflammatory properties in them. It is also the main ingredient in traditional oxymels, which are used to treat cough and cold. It is particularly helpful in relieving a sore throat since the acid content in the solutions helps eliminate the infection spreading bad bacteria, which cause inflammation in the throat. To relieve symptoms, drinking a glass of warm water mixed with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar can prove to be helpful. You can also add honey for additional taste and benefits.",

    "1. Walk in a new way. Immerse yourself in the full experience of walking outdoors by adding a mindfulness element. Notice the smell of the air, the variety of flowers and trees and the feel of the sun or the wind as you move. Bringing your attention to these things can give your conscious mind a break from your worries and unleash your creativity. You might find new ideas and solutions coming to you when you weren’t even aware you were working on them. If you find you need to up the intensity of your walks, look for hills, do some step ups on the curb at each corner, skip, or even jump up and down the curb a few times (if appropriate for your fitness level and joints).  2. 2. Interval training Whether you're a beginner or an exercise veteran, a walker or an aerobic dancer, adding interval training to your cardiovascular workout will boost your fitness level and help you lose weight. 3. LungesChallenging your balance is an essential part of a well-rounded exercise routine. Lunges do just that, promoting functional movement, while also increasing strength in your legs and glutes.",
